title: Why Am I Doing What I Am Doing?
---

We call those brave people as entrepreneurs. Even though the number of those people have been increased enormously, I feel that there are only handful people who know what they are actually doing.

I like keeping good books around me. Especially, I always keep a copy of Paulo Coelho's masterpiece, "Alchemist." I like the part where Santigo met a king of Salem, and discussed about his 'Personal Legend,'which is about answering the question: 

<strong> "Why am I doing what I am doing?" </strong>

This question is essential. Something we need to put on the wall. 

I count my days how many times I asked that question. When my answer is not clear, I know something is wrong.
